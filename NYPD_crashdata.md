# NYPD Vehicle Collisions

In this project I explored the [NYPD Crash Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95?). I used python to read and manipulate the datea and matplotlib to makes the plots. Given that ggplot I have struggeled with ggplot to work with python I used matplotlib but used "ggplot style".

I used pandas dataframes to aggregate injuries / deaths by borough and plotted them. The preliminary plots I made are bar charts that show the number of injuries by vehicle type per borough.

##Conclusions

# Plots Looking at the time of day crashes happen
Tell us something about date or time of day and traffic crashes.


# Potential Research Projects

+ Do speed limits prevent total number of crashes. This year, Manhattan lowered the speed limit. It would be interesting to plot a year over year comparing the differenes due to the changes in speed.
+ Does weather play into total number of crashes
